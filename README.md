spv
========

Just simple QT5/QML image viewer to be started from command line (or mc) to view all photos in folder.
Created due to lack anything like this for OSX... and shared on github just for fun :)

Usage:
  spv /path/to/any/jpeg/image.jpg

  LEFT/RIGHT keys used to go forward/backward
  ESCAPE key to exit
