spv
========

Just simple QT5/QML photo viewer to be started from command line (or mc) to view all photos in folder.
Created due to lack anything like this for OSX... and shared on github just for fun :)

Usage:
  spv /path/to/any/jpeg/image.jpg

  LEFT/RIGHT keys used to go forward/backward

  UP/DOWN keys to go to first/last photo

  SPACE key to toggle fit to window / original size

  ESCAPE key to exit
